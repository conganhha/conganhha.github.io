Jekyll is a powerful static site generator that makes it easy to create a modern blog. In this post, we'll explore how to get started with Jekyll and create a beautiful, performant blog.

## What is Jekyll?

Jekyll is a static site generator written in Ruby. It takes your content written in Markdown, passes it through templates, and generates a complete, static website ready to be served by any web server.

## Key Features

1. **Simple & Fast**
   - No database required
   - Minimal server requirements
   - Lightning-fast page loads

2. **Markdown Support**
   - Write content in Markdown
   - Easy to learn and use
   - Focus on content, not formatting

3. **Flexible Templating**
   - Liquid templating language
   - Reusable layouts and includes
   - Custom plugins support

## Getting Started

Here's a simple example of how to create a new Jekyll site:

```bash
# Install Jekyll
gem install bundler jekyll

# Create a new site
jekyll new my-blog

# Start the development server
cd my-blog
